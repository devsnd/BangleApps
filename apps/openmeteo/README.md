# Open-Meteo weather provider

This updates [Weather](https://banglejs.com/apps/#weather) with data from the Open-Meteo API.
No API key needed, it just werksâ„¢.

This needs an internet-enabled Gadgetbridge version.
Install [My Location](https://banglejs.com/apps/#mylocation) to change the location for the weather requests.
