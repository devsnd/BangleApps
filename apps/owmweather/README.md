# OpenWeatherMap weather provider

This updates [Weather](https://banglejs.com/apps/#weather) with data from the OpenWeatherMap API

## Usage

Just install and configure the app. This needs an internet-enabled Gadgetbridge version.
Install [My Location](https://banglejs.com/apps/#mylocation) to change the location for the weather requests.
Install one of the text input libraries to set the API key in the app settings or use the web interface.

You can either use the free API (2.5) or you can use the paid subscription API 3.0.
The paid API also includes pressure data. You can use the API 3.0 by enabling it in
the settings.
